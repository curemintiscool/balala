            As a human, <u>Azure has long silver curly hair</u> and big ice blue eyes, slightly slanted bangs, white skin, and delicate facial features. She wears a blue headband, a blue coat, a dark blue dress, and a pair of blue sandals. She wears a cyan shell-shaped ring with a bracelet on her left hand.

As a fairy, <em>she has long straight blue hair with yellow shades</em> and long unilateral bangs. Her eyes turn bright blue and gain yellow stars. She wears a white headband on the head (wings on both sides of the headband), a blue dress with a translucent sky blue layer, and white over-the-knee boots with some cyan and yellow patterns. She has stingray wings on her back.

Her headband remains the same in her princess form, but she gains a fan-shaped crown in the middle. She wears a teal cape with fluffy white trimming attached to a golden button that holds the cape. There is also a long blue rhombus that attaches to the top and the cape. She loses her sleeves, and her top slightly changes and has a blue gem in the middle. Her gloves become longer and become white. The top of her gloves has a dark blue crown-shaped border. The belt that holds her skirt is yellow with a blue diamond in the middle. Her long dress has a short dark blue layer with a yellow border. The rest of her skirt is white.
        </p>

        <p>Azure's last name, 娜 (nà), means "<b>elegant</b>". Her Chinese first name, 希雅, (xī yǎ), means "<b>hopeful and stylish</b>", with 希 (xī), meaning "<b>hope</b>", and 雅 (yǎ), meaning stylish.

            Azure means "<i>Sky Blue</i>" in Spanish.</p>
        </p>
        She was ranked 1st place in the August 2021 Popularity Poll conducted by the official Balala the Fairies Weibo page.<br>
Her English name "Azure" could be a reference to the ocean being blue and her being the blue fairy.<br>
She is the oldest fairy at debut, supplanting Shirley.<br>
Her blood type is A.<br>
She is 166 cm tall.<br>
<strong> Azure is the only girl in her group who has long hair, though her hair does get shorter in the 2nd season, presumably to make it easier to animate. However, in Season 2, Finn also gains long hair.<br> </strong>
Azure is the only member who has a significant hair change when transformed.<br>
In season 1, her weapon used to be a sword-like wand, but in Season 2, her weapon has changed to a bow and arrow.<br>
Although there are many fairies in this season, Azure is still considered the most powerful fairy of the season.<br>
